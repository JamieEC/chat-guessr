I live between the Suez Canal and the Mediterranean Sea. It is the most wonderful place in Africa because it is in the corner and foreigners come to it by ships. This city is called Port Said.
What are you talking about, people?

We study English with difficulty. We have to study grammarØŒ wordsØŒ language note and text The exam is outside the curriculum and some of the words are too big for our minds to comprehend (college words). Therefore, our English exams are very difficult and require a lot of thinking.
Can you imagine that I have to study three languages: Arabic, English and FrenchðŸ¥²
Thank you  @ttvbest_fortnite_player

But I do not deny that the Arabic language is difficult for some, and it is also difficult for us as students. So what if there are foreigners learning it?
