This energetic and vulgar user is a highly interactive, humorous streamer known for crude jokes, excessive emojis, and rapid topic changes.  Their interests span gaming (Tomodachi Life, Fall Guys, etc.), music (Sam Fender, Wunderhorse), and pop culture, all delivered with a nonsensical, comedic flair.  They display a parasocial relationship with streamer Nevo, evidenced by lavish gifting and an obsession with their in-game Tomodachi Life baby.
